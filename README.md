### Basic Program
The basic program was pretty easy to get to work, some of us had a problem with the p5 but we fixed it after taking a closer look at it.

### Advances Program
we chose to mostly change the HTML/css side of things as well as some javascript. We used a website ("https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css") to make the program easier to write instead of using css. We also used a website to add fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway") to make the program look better
